# MetaDiv Go Mod

To initialize your go project, you should run the following command to `go mod init`:

```base
go mod init github.com/metadiv-go-tech/project
```

- we always use the `github.com/metadiv-go-tech` as the prefix of the module name.
- `project` is the name of the project, you should replace it with your project name.
